Anomaly Detection in Business Time Series

This template can be used to detect and quantify anomalies for any time-series dataset. In this example, I used the local average temperature in Ottawa to replicate ice cream sales seasonality for a small ice cream shop in Canada. I artificially added an unexpected event (increase of 20% in the sales of ice cream for 10 days starting June 15th, 2019). This methodology was developped to demonstrate that the model accurately quantifies the 20% increase in ice cream sales and flags it as an unexpected event.
